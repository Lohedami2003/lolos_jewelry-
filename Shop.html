                        <p>1781 Ruby Studded Necklace</p>

                            Originally commissioned in 1781, this ruby-studded necklace was crafted by Duke Albert Christopher 
                            in honor of his late wife, Deaconess Rosetta Christopher. His search for its precious materials 
                            began more than a decade earlier, in 1770, during a diplomatic visit to the estate of the Count of Kambaska. 
                            It was there, amid the Count’s gardens, that the Duke first encountered Aurora’s Kiss—a deep, velvety red dahlia 
                            whose richness and strength reminded him unmistakably of his beloved Rosetta.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                            Yet such brilliance was rare. The ruby—the only gemstone capable of matching the flower’s vivid hue— 
                            could be found neither in Kambaska nor in the Duke’s homeland. His pursuit carried him across 
                            distant lands and spanned many arduous years. When Duke Christopher finally returned in 1781, bearing 
                            the completed necklace, he was met with devastating news: Deaconess Rosetta had passed away in his absence. 
                            According to her headmaid, she had resisted death for as long as she could, sustained by the hope of 
                            seeing her husband one final time. <br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As the Duke gently placed the necklace into her cold hands, he whispered only two words:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            "<i>There Rose</i>".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These words would later be translated into French as <i>La Rose</i> —a name that endures, entwined forever 
                            with love, loss, and devotion.
                        </p>
